# Bank Customer Churn Analysis

Customer churn is a significant challenge for financial institutions, impacting revenue and profitability. Understanding the key drivers of churn can help banks develop effective retention strategies. This project aims to analyze customer behavior, segment customers based on their banking activities, and uncover patterns that distinguish churned customers from retained ones.

## Project Objective

Key Business Questions to Solve:
1. Understanding Customer Churn
- ✅ What attributes (e.g., credit score, balance, tenure, number of products) are most common among churners?
- ✅ What is the overall churn rate? How does it vary across demographics?
- ✅ Are customers with higher balances more likely to stay or leave?
2. Customer Segmentation & Behavioral Analysis
- ✅ Can customers be grouped into different segments based on their banking behavior?
- ✅ How do high-value customers (e.g., high balance, multiple products) compare to low-value customers?
- ✅ What proportion of churned customers had multiple products vs. single products?
3. Geographic & Demographic Trends
- ✅ How does churn rate differ by country (France, Spain, Germany)?
- ✅ Do older customers have a lower churn rate compared to younger customers?
- ✅ Is there a significant difference in churn between male and female customers?
4. Customer Engagement & Activity Levels
- ✅ Do inactive members have a higher churn rate than active members?
- ✅ What is the relationship between credit score and churn?
- ✅ Are customers with credit cards less likely to churn?
5. Financial & Revenue Insights
- ✅ What is the average balance and salary of churned vs. retained customers?
- ✅ Are customers with lower credit scores more likely to churn?

## Data Cleaning

-	Renaming of table
```sql
Rename table `bank customer churn data.zip` to Bank_Customer_Churn;
select * from bank_customer_churn;
```
-	To check for duplicate
```sql
select creditscore, balance, tenure, numofproducts, hascrcard, age, estimatedsalary, count(*) from bank_customer_churn
group by creditscore, balance, tenure, numofproducts,hascrcard, age, estimatedsalary
having count(*) > 1;
```
-	Adding new columns to the table
```sql
Alter table bank_customer_churn
 add column Age_group text after Age;
 ```
 ```sql
set SQL_SAFE_UPDATES=0;
 update bank_customer_churn
 set Age_group = case
				when age between 0 and 20 then "Youth"
				when age between 21 and 41 then "Young_Adult"
				when age between 45 and 64 then "Middle_Age"
				when age between 63 and 83 then "Seniors"
				else "Elderly"
				end;
```
```sql
Alter table bank_customer_churn
add column NHI int after isactivemember;
```
 ```sql
set SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;
 Update bank_customer_churn
 set NHI = concat(Numofproducts+ HasCrCard+IsActivemember);
```
